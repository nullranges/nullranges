# nullranges 1.0.0

* `nullranges` is released on Bioconductor! the package offers
  the creation of null genomic feature sets, either through
  sampling from a pool in order to match covariates with a 
  particular focal set, or via block bootstrapping of 
  features optionally with respect to a genome segmentation.
  Critically, nullranges is designed as a modular package,
  solely for the purpose of generating null feature sets, 
  and to be used in conjunction with another package for
  calculating overlaps, such as `GenomicRanges` or `plyranges`.

  Bioconductor support site or through GitHub Issues.
